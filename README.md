## üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Guides

<details>
<summary><strong>LFI (Local File Inclusion)</strong></summary>

**What is LFI?**
Local File Inclusion allows attackers to include files from the server, leading to sensitive data exposure or code execution.

**Testing Steps:**

* Look for parameters like `?page=about.php`
* Try: `?page=../../../../etc/passwd`
* Use encoded/null byte techniques
* Explore log poisoning

**Learn More:**

* [OWASP LFI Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/File_Upload_Cheat_Sheet.html)
* [PortSwigger LFI Guide](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal)
* [HackTricks LFI](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SQL Injection (SQLi)</strong></summary>

**What is SQLi?**
A code injection vulnerability that allows execution of SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access.

**Testing Steps:**

* `' OR '1'='1`
* UNION and error-based tests
* Time-based blind injection

**Learn More:**

* [OWASP SQL Injection Guide](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)</strong></summary>

**What is XSS?**
Allows attackers to inject JavaScript into web pages, affecting other users.

**Testing Steps:**

* `<script>alert(1)</script>`
* HTML injection (e.g., `<h1>XSS</h1>`)
* Check for stored, reflected, and DOM-based vectors

**Learn More:**

* [OWASP XSS Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Open Redirect (OR)</strong></summary>

**What is Open Redirect?**
A vulnerability that redirects users to untrusted locations via user-controlled input.

**Testing Steps:**

* Parameters like `?next=`, `?redirect=`
* Use: `?url=https://evil.com`

**Learn More:**

* [OWASP Redirect Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html)

<details>
<summary><strong>CRLF Injection</strong></summary>

**What is CRLF?**
Inserts carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) to manipulate HTTP headers.

**Testing Steps:**

* Use `%0D%0A` in URL params
* Look for response splitting

**Learn More:**

* [OWASP Headers Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)
